                      Itâ€™s official, bitcoin is not a currency. The Internal Revenue Service ruled in May 2014 that the Bitcoin and its rivals will be
                      treated as property, not cash, for tax purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The ruling had been expected and marked another step in the wider attempt to make bitcoin mainstream. In its notice, the IRS
                      said bitcoin would be treated like stock or other intangible property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      "The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for US federal tax purposes. General tax principles that apply
                      to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency," according to an IRS news release.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The ruling means gains in value will be treated as capital gains and as such could be subject to lower tax rates than income.
                      The top long-term capital gains tax rate is 20%, while the top ordinary income tax rate is 39.6%.
